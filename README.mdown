# Animate.sass re-imagined   
##### Refer to http://daneden.me/animate/ to view animations
----

Animate.sass is a Sass and Compass CSS animation library for WebKit, Firefox and beyond based on the work being done by [Dan Eden](https://github.com/daneden) in [Animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate/).

The core of Animate.sass, despite being named "dot sass", is written in [SCSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scss).

This is a forked version of animate.sass, updated to v2.1 of animate.css, and leveraging techniques to minimize css bloat. The standard library is over 3400+ lines of code unminified, using sass, you only have to use the portions which make sense for your project.

Animate.sass is a Sass and Compass CSS animation library for WebKit, Firefox and beyond based on the work being done by [Dan Eden](https://github.com/daneden) in [Animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate/).

The core of Animate.sass, despite being named "dot sass", is written in [SCSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scss). Don't hate.

## Installation

1. `gem install animate-sass`
2. Add `require 'animate-sass'` in Compass's `config.rb` file
3. Then `@import animate.sass` at the top of your main sass file.

## Usage

Here's how it works:    

1. include the keyframes you want to use in your code. 
    Note: Animation keyframes cannot be nested, they must be at the base level of your sass file.   

    Include the entire entrances animations family
    ```
    @include animation-keyframes(fading-entrances); 
    ```
    Or include just the fadeInRight keyframe 
    ```  
    @include animation-keyframes(fading-entrances/fadeInRight);
    ```

2. use the animation mixin to include the animation in your css.
```
.my-class {
    @include animations(fadeInRight);
}
```
#### Example

    This example will attach the animate.css keyframes for the fadeInRight animation inside the class 'my-class'.
    ```
    @include animation-keyframes(fading-entrances/fadeInRight);
    .my-class {
        @include animations(fadeInRight);
    }
    ```

## Credits and special thanks

Huge thanks to [Dan Eden](https://github.com/daneden) on his project [Animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate/). This project would not exist without his hard work. Thanks as well to Nick Pettit for his CSS3 animation library [Glide](https://github.com/nickpettit/glide).

Special thanks needs to also go out to [Thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com/) and [Bourbon](https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon). I borrowed some of their CSS3 animation mixins and "tailor fit" them to my needs.

Also, I want to thank [theCSSguru](https://twitter.com/theCSSguru), [adamstac](https://github.com/adamstac), and [polikin](https://github.com/polikin) for earlier versions and contributions of this framework.
